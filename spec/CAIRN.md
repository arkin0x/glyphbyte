Cairns: URLs findable by event id prefix
----------------------------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines `kind:1738`, a **cairn**: a regular event whose only job is to carry one URL, so
that the URL can be found again from the first few bytes of the event's id. A cairn is the
nostr equivalent of a stack of stones on a trail: anyone can build one anywhere, and it points
the way to somewhere else.

The kind number is a mnemonic for [RFC 1738](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1738), *Uniform
Resource Locators (URL)*.

## Motivation

A nostr event id is 32 bytes. Its first 6 to 8 bytes are already almost certainly unique among
all the events on a relay, and a few bytes are short enough to carry by other means than a
link: drawn as [GlyphByte](https://glyphbyte.dev) glyphs on paper, chalk or a wall, read aloud,
or typed by hand. A cairn turns any URL into such an event, so any URL can travel as a handful of
bytes: publish a cairn for the URL, take the leading bytes of its id, and anyone holding those
bytes can ask a relay for the event and follow the URL.

Cairns get their own kind so that they never appear in anyone's feed (unlike `kind:1` notes),
carry no social meaning (unlike `kind:17` reactions to a website, [NIP-25](25.md)), and never change
once published (unlike `kind:39701` web bookmarks, [NIP-B0](B0.md), whose id changes with every
edit and would break every copy of its prefix).

## Event format

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 1738,
  "content": "https://example.com/menu?table=4 lunch menu for table 4",
  "tags": [
    ["r", "https://example.com/menu?table=4"],      // required: the URL, exactly one
    ["alt", "Cairn: https://example.com/menu?table=4"] // recommended
  ],
  // ...other fields
}
```

### `r` tag (required)

Exactly one `r` tag ([NIP-24](24.md): a reference to a web URL). Its value is **the URL** of the
cairn, an absolute URI, stored exactly as the publisher gave it: no normalization, so that query
strings, fragments and letter case survive unchanged. The `r` tag is the only part of a cairn that
a reader opens or displays as the destination.

A cairn with no `r` tag, or with more than one, is invalid.

### `content`

Free text for people, usually the URL followed by a short comment. The content MAY omit the URL
entirely, and MAY be empty.

If the content contains URLs, at least one of them MUST equal the `r` URL exactly. For this rule
a URL in the content is any whitespace-separated token that begins with `http://` or `https://`,
or with the scheme of the `r` URL followed by `:`. Publishers SHOULD put whitespace after a URL in
the content (a space or a line break), so that sentence punctuation is never mistaken for part of
it; readers compare whole tokens and do not strip punctuation.

Putting the URL first in the content makes the cairn useful in clients that know nothing about
this kind: many show the content of an unknown event, and the URL in it stays clickable.

### `alt` tag (recommended)

A human-readable description for clients that do not know this kind, of the exact form
`Cairn: <URL>`, where `<URL>` equals the `r` URL exactly. A cairn whose `alt` tag is present but
does not have this form is invalid.

### Other tags (optional)

- `["title", "<title>"]`: a short title for the destination, as in [NIP-B0](B0.md). For display only.
- `["expiration", "<unix seconds>"]`: [NIP-40](40.md), for cairns meant to disappear.

### Immutability

A cairn is a regular event and MUST NOT be replaced or edited: copies of its id prefix may exist
anywhere, on paper or in stone. To point somewhere else, publish a new cairn. A cairn can be
withdrawn with a [NIP-09](09.md) deletion request.

## Publishing

Any key may publish a cairn, including a fresh key made for that one cairn: a browser extension or
a button on an ordinary website can create one for a visitor without any nostr account. Before
publishing, a client MAY query `{"kinds": [1738], "#r": ["<URL>"]}` and reuse an existing cairn for
the same URL instead of creating another.

The prefix of the event id is what people carry. Clients SHOULD present at least the first
**6 bytes** (12 hex characters) of the id, and MAY present more.

Cairns SHOULD be published to relays that answer prefix queries (below).

## Looking up a cairn by prefix

```json
["REQ", "cairn", {"ids": ["50e4e5e0ec93"], "kinds": [1738]}]
```

Prefix matching in `ids` was part of the first version of [NIP-01](01.md) and was removed from its
text in 2023; NIP-01 now requires full 64-character ids. Some relay software still answers
prefixes (for example [grain](https://github.com/0ceanslim/grain), which accepts prefixes of any
length), others reject them (`CLOSED`) or return nothing. Clients SHOULD test a relay before relying
on it, for example by fetching one event and asking for it again by an 8-character prefix.

A cairn shared by its full id (a [NIP-19](19.md) `nevent`) works on every relay; the prefix lookup
is what needs a prefix-capable relay.

## Reader behavior

A reader resolving a prefix:

1. MUST NOT resolve a cairn from fewer than 6 bytes (12 hex characters).
2. MUST discard results that are not valid cairns (the rules above) and results whose id does not
   start with the prefix.
3. MUST show every valid match, never pick one silently, and MUST NOT open a URL without the
   person's action.
4. MUST display the destination from the `r` tag, with its host shown prominently, and never a
   destination taken from the content.
5. MUST refuse to open `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:` and `file:` URLs, and SHOULD show any
   scheme other than `https:` explicitly.
6. MAY mark a cairn as **published by its domain** when the cairn's pubkey is the root identity of
   the URL's host under [NIP-05](05.md): `https://<host>/.well-known/nostr.json?name=_` lists the
   pubkey under the name `_`. A website that publishes cairns with its own key gets this mark; a
   cairn from a fresh key is simply unmarked.

## Security considerations

**Prefix collisions by design.** An attacker can generate events until one's id starts with a
chosen prefix, then publish a cairn to a different URL under the same prefix. Each extra byte
multiplies the work by 256. At about 2 × 10^10 SHA-256 hashes per second on one current GPU, a
forged match takes on the order of: 4 bytes, under a second; 6 bytes, hours; 8 bytes, decades.
This is why readers show every match with its host and never open one automatically (rules 3 and
4), and why publishers of high-value links SHOULD present 8 bytes and SHOULD sign with a key their
domain vouches for (rule 6). Cairns from fresh keys carry no reputation: the prefix length and the
displayed host are their only protection.

**Accidental collisions.** With N cairns on a relay, the chance that another one shares a given
6-byte prefix is about N / 2^48: for N = 10^8, about 4 × 10^-7.

**Decoy URLs in the content.** The content may contain URLs other than the `r` URL. Generic
clients may display them as links; cairn readers never treat them as the destination (rule 4).

**Relay acceptance.** Relays may refuse events of kinds they do not know, or from keys without
history. A cairn is only findable where it is stored: publishers SHOULD confirm the relay's `OK`.

## Example

A cairn signed with a fresh key (never published):

```json
{
  "kind": 1738,
  "id": "50e4e5e0ec933d2b12b0e0cbe49b062ce38870d73d901830b528d748b8e5467a",
  "pubkey": "a97754301f691c73ac24eb50a932f006b1fba4f33fff10b59ddb44455b7473b2",
  "created_at": 1790000000,
  "tags": [
    ["r", "https://example.com/menu?table=4"],
    ["alt", "Cairn: https://example.com/menu?table=4"]
  ],
  "content": "https://example.com/menu?table=4 lunch menu for table 4",
  "sig": "d66bc5bb94906f734e154879a0fd4775833679afdc868a2264a61b8964153413daa1743f1a4c5850ff6de5e0de8eac354fef5b3d923057f8d1fbc75ce7a4ca04"
}
```

Its first 6 bytes, `50e4e5e0ec93`, drawn as GlyphByte glyphs: arrow, no dots; star, dot top-right;
star, dots top-right and bottom-left; star, no dots; star, dots top-left and top-right; tree, dots
bottom-right and bottom-left. A reader that sees the drawing sends the `REQ` above and shows a link
to `https://example.com/menu?table=4`.
